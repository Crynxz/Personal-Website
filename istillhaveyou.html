      <p> I Still Have You is a short, animated movie, co-produced and directed by me and my collegue, Pedro Martins, serving as the final project of our degree in Multimedia at ESMAD.</p>
      <h1 class="credits"> Synopse </h1>
          <p>Through carefully depicted and animated expressions through the character's faces and body language, and the music and sounds that accompany and emphasize these, it is illustrated the story of a young little girl who tries to find a way to cheer up and connect with her father after the loss of the mother.</p>

         <h1 class="credits"> Tools </h1>
      <p> This project was the product of the ingenuity of the use of several software programs, like Adobe Photoshop for pre-production work like the storyboard, character design references, and illustrations created to be used in the movie, Autodesk Maya and Blender for 3D modelling, Adobe Substance 3D Painter for texturing, Marvelous Designer for clothes creation, Reaper for music and SFX composition and editing, Adobe Premiere for video editing and assembly and finally Adobe After Effects to animate the title sequence and the final credits.
